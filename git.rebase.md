The reset command is used to change the state of the Git repository or undo commits.

Note: This command is ideal for undoing uncommitted changes made in a private, local repository. For undoing changes in a public, remote repository, the revert command is recommended.

Syntax
git reset <mode-option> <commit-reference>
